# Introduction
{:.no_toc}

After automatically editing annotations using 
[Prokker](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/annotation-with-prokka/tutorial.html) or 
[Maker](https://training.galaxyproject.org/training-material/topics/genome-annotation/tutorials/annotation-with-maker/tutorial.html),
 its important to visualize and then manually refine any additional data. 

This process is most often done as part of a group.  

This demo is inspired by the [Apollo User's Guide](http://genomearchitect.github.io/users-guide/), which provides additional guidance. 

***TODO***: *Add links to the Apollo User's Gropu and GGA*

# Data upload

To annotate a genome using Apollo, you simply need the reference genome sequence in FASTA format.

We will also need to provide evidence for our refined annotations.  

This will result in several types of evidence:

- If not *de novo*, then this could include a previous released official genome annotation.
- A set of prior gene predictions or other genomic feature types if available (provided for this example) typically as GFF3.  
- Individual read files in BAM format if available.
- Additional visual data to help indicate things like read density such as BigWig files.

# Setup Apollo for Annotation

Refining genomes happens in multiple steps:

- register a user, injecting the user from Galaxy into Apollo
- create a viewable genome or organism from the reference genome FASTA file
- add genomic evidence
- refine the genome (more on that)
- export the refined genome annotations

The idea is to keep the theory description before quite simple to focus more on the practical part.

> ### {% icon details %} Why bother?
>
> Automated annotation programs continue to improve, however a simple score may not provide the visual evidence necessary to confirm an accurate prediction.
> Therefore, it is necessary to both visually inspect as well as fix any issues with the predicted genomes.
> 
> Additionally, many times assemblies are less than perfect or read depth and quality may be insufficient.

# Create refinements

View data at a particular position

## Search for a gene

Enter the gene XXX into the gene box.  

Zoom in to the proper region.

## Create structural edits

Drag annotation from evidence to HTML region. 
 
Conversely, if you right-click you can any type of genome feature annotation.

Additional isoforms may be dragged up from the evidence.

## Edit structure

### Update exon position
Once isoforms have been created, the edges may be dragged to best match the biological evidence.   

CDS's are automatically updated. 

Conversely by selecting "choose the annotation" the individual code view is selected. 

You will also notice that overlapping isoforms are highlighted.

(SCREEN SHOT of isoforms and dragging exons)
![Alternative text](../../images/image_name "Legend of the image")

Genes will automatically be predicted based on CDS overlap.  This can be unassigned by deselecting on the right-click menu.

By right-clicking on the refined genome feature the details of the genome feature can be retrieved quite readily.

Selecting the features allows us to view the gene directly.

#### Add comments, keys, and values



#### Show GO Annotations


## Executing the workflow 


# Export refinements



# Add users to help with the refinement

# Conclusion
{:.no_toc}

Congratulations, you finished this tutorial! You learned how to manually refine predicted eukaryotic genomes using Apollo and export them to other forms.

By using Apollo and JBrowse you can inspect and refine genome annotations with other researchers. 
When refinement is sufficient an updated or new version of the genome may be exported as GFF3 as well as published as a new JBrowse directory for inspection.

# What's next?

After generating your refined genome, you'll want to merge it back into the official gene sets.  

If a de novo set, you can export it as GFF3 and load it into a tool like [Tripal](http://tripal.info) to provide visualization.
